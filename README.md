# TestPro-Nuxt4 (A Nuxt 4 Test Project)

I have developed a project using Nuxt 4 where I integrated a dummy API for development purposes. Currently, the project focuses on data fetching. In the next phase, I plan to enhance it into an e-commerce–style application by adding features such as an Add to Cart system, also powered by a dummy API.
